# Rock, Paper & Scissors

Tiny and simple website to play rock paper and scissors online with your friends. The website is hosted by glitch at this link: [rock-paper-scissors-by-stefano.glitch.me/](https://rock-paper-scissors-by-stefano.glitch.me/). Have fun!

It is my first journey into web development, so please be forgiving about my coding style and about the very very minimal GUI (it's soooo boring to do the frontend).
